"""Single-binary dispatch entry point for PyInstaller builds.

The frozen binary is shipped as `codex-chronicle` and symlinked to
`codex-chronicle-hook`
at install time (busybox pattern). sys.argv[0] basename picks which command
to run, so a single ~10MB binary replaces the two venv console scripts AND
the self-healing shell wrappers.
