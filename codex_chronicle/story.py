architecture, decisions, problems solved, evolution over time.

STORY_PROMPT = """\
You are writing a unified engineering story for a software project. You will receive \
the full content of every chronicle session in chronological order. Your job is to \
synthesize them into a single, cohesive markdown document that a technical lead or \
CTO can read to understand the entire project: what was built, how it evolved, every \
significant decision, every problem encountered and solved, the architecture, and \
where things stand now.

RULES:
- Write in chronological order. The reader should feel the project unfolding.
- Preserve exact technical details: filenames, commands, config values, error messages, \
numbers, versions, timings. Do not generalize.
- Preserve ALL decisions with their rationale and alternatives considered.
- Preserve ALL problems solved with diagnosis and verification.
- Group related work into logical phases or chapters, not by session. A phase might \
span multiple sessions or a single session might contain multiple phases.
- Include the developer's reasoning and judgment calls — what they were optimizing for, \
where they pushed back, what changed their mind.
- Include tool usage patterns: which Codex tools were used, what commands were run, \
what files were read or modified. This shows the engineering workflow.
- End with a "Current State" section: what's working, what's not, open questions, \
next steps.
- Write like a senior engineer's project journal, not a formal report. Use first \
person plural ("we decided", "we hit a wall", "turns out the issue was").
- Use markdown headings, bullet lists, and code blocks for readability.
- Start with a brief project overview paragraph, then dive into the chronological story.
- Do NOT omit sessions even if they seem trivial — include them as brief notes to \
maintain the complete timeline.

Return ONLY the markdown document. No fences wrapping it. Start with a # heading.
